# Dataset Instruction

## Overview

This repository contains datasets of constraints on spin-dependent exotic interactions, also referred to as the spin-dependent fifth force (SDFF), mediated by the exchange of a single boson of mass M between fermions X and Y. The interactions are categorized into the following types:

1. Axial-vector/vector, axial-vector/axial-vector, vector/vector.
2. Pseudoscalar/scalar, pseudoscalar/pseudoscalar, scalar/scalar.
3. Tensor/tensor, pseudotensor/tensor, and pseudotensor/pseudotensor.

As a reference, one may consult the format of the exotic potentials presented in the RMP review: [**Spin-Dependent Exotic Interactions**](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.15691).

The repository serves as a **live** webpage designed to present the latest experimental results. For contributions or to include your new results, please feel free to contact Dr. Lei Cong (congllzu@gmail.com), Dr. Wei Ji (weiji001@uni-mainz.de), or Prof. Dmitry Budker (budker@uni-mainz.de).
